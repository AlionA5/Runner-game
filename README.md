## How to Run

### Windows
1. Download `game.exe` from this repository.
2. Double-click the file to start the game.
   - If you see a security warning, click "More info" and "Run anyway" (if you trust the source).

### Requirements
- No installation is needed! Just run the exe.
- If you see missing DLL errors, install the latest [Visual C++ Redistributable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist).

### Running on macOS/Linux
Windows `.exe` files won't run natively. Use Wine or a Windows emulator.
